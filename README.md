## About The Project

This project was programmed by four colleagues who had the task of implementing a system similar to Skelbiu.lt. 

The system was programmed using ASP.NET framework and Sql server as database. In this project we also implemented a Gmail API connection and billing using Paypal API.

Also we have a listing page where you can create a new product listing. An administration page where you can see suspended listings and all other administration functions. An inventory page where a seller can see all the listings they have placed, edit their information and delete them. There is also a search engine and a search filter system.
